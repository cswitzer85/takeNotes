## About the Project
takeNotes is a locally hosted project that allows the user to add, read and delete notes. The front end was defined by SMU Coding Boot Camp as were various other documents in order to require students of the Boot Camp to learn how to build development approaches based on factors that they have no control over.

## Getting Started
    Pre-requisites:
        This project requires node modules, if these are not present, you will need to use `npm init` to retrieve them.
        The server.js file must be run in order to host the project locally, this file requires express and path.
        Open takeNotes in your favorite code editor or terminal/console and make sure your commands will be associated with the correct file location.
    Installation:
        If you do not have node_modules included in your download, type the following into the terminal...
            `npm init`
        If you do not have express and path installed, type the following into the terminal...
            `npm install express path`
    Launch:
        Once all the pre-requisites have been satisfied, type the following into the terminal...
            `node server.js`
            or
            `nodemon server.js`

Once on the notes page, any previously saved notes will persist. If you would like to add another note, simply type something into the Title and Text section, then click the save button on the top right. If a previous note is being displayed, click on the pencil icon to be able to add your new note.
